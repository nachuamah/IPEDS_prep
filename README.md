# IPEDS_prep
This script automates the download, unzipping, preparation, and merging of the following data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for any year the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collected information:

        1.  graduation data
        2.  institution characteristic data


In order to run this script, you will need the following python libraries:

        1.  urllib
        2.  tempfile
        3.  shutil
        4.  re
        5.  io
        6.  subprocess
        7.  time
        8.  sys
        9.  os


To run the script, fork/branch the repository or download the .py file to the folder/location in which you would like the stata file to be created. Then you must run the script through the command line, after moving to the working directory, as you will have to input the year shortly after running the script.

Best of luck!
